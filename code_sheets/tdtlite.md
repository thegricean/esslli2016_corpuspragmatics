# TDTlite tutorial

Download the factives project into your home directory by cloning it from github:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thegricean/esslli2016_corpuspragmatics.git
```

Navigate to the factives project and list the contents:
```
$ cd esslli2016_corpuspragmatics/factives
$ ls
MACROS.ptn options ptn
```
You should see that there are two files (MACROS.ptn and options) and one directory (ptn). To run a project, we'll need to add two more directories: one which will hold the data and one which will hold the resulting database. Go ahead and create these directories. Note: these directories **must** be called 'data' and 'results'.

```
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir results
```
