2301:11	###\[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] \+ \[ alwa- , \+ \] well , that 's \] kind of a hobby E_S ###but it is self improvement from the standpoint of * probably relaxing , uh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah , E_S 
2470:38	###I 'm the same way 0 you are *T*-1 , E_S ###I kind of try *-1 to judge from day to day . E_S ###I know , you know , 0 where I am *T*-1 we work a lot with the customers E_S ###and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time E_S

2513:12	###SpeakerB20 . ###And the supervisor from another area came up to us E_S ###and , you know , this area where record retention is *T*-1 , there 's only a few people that *T*-2 work there , E_S ###and \[ he , sho- , \+ he \] knew who *T*-1 worked there , E_S

6228:63	###But , uh , it 's , N_S ###I guess 0 now is the time 0 * to think about it *T*-1 , E_S ###so . Does T I have a pretty good retirement package , do you think ? E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
6319:21	###what it 's going *-1 to cost *T*-2 sixteen years from now is just really scary .

6565:6	###Did you ever get any information on it like , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###I sent off for stuff on it , E_S ###but I do n't remember that much . about it . E_S

7506:9	###I think 0 in , uh , the Texas governor elections , I think more people turned out *-1 to vote against somebody than for somebody , this time . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , that , uh , N_S

8353:8	###How about in your case ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , in my case my husband is not a carpenter , E_S ###but , in fact , he 's in electronics , E_S

9187:9	###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###And I do think that we have a responsibility there . E_S 
9218:53	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###I suspect \[ that the pub- , \+ \] that there 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be a lot of pressure , uh , come * to bear on the companies that *T*-4 deal with it E_S

16056:6	###and they really have a good campaign for the young people , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . 
16251:9	###they 're coming up from Florida , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Oh , well , that 's good E_S

20765:6	###Well , I know that we have some relatives that *T*-1 live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
20881:8	###SpeakerB48 . ###Some of our neighbors were doing it E_S ###and so , you know , when I found out some places 0 * to take it *T*-1 *T*-2 , N_S ###and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there , E_S 
20946:6	###SpeakerA71 . ###Well , it *EXP*-1 was good * to talk to you . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Well , it *EXP*-1 was nice * to talk to you . E_S

22498:11	###Have you fly fished ? E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh , no E_S ###I have n't *?* . E_S

23580:20	###It 's in there some place . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
24088:19	###Uh , once they have that , then they can start *-1 looking in all the various publications that *T*-2 give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves , and start *-1 finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind \[ of , \+ uh , of \] job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer *T*-3 .

24191:14	###I just wanted a law degree . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
24275:11	###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###there is , N_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think , uh , 0 law would be \[ a fine field , \+ a fine profession , \] fine field 0 * to go into *T*-1 . E_S

24551:11	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , not if it 's done *-1 fairly . E_S ###And that 's probably my question is , \[ how , \+ how \] do you know 0 it 's done *-1 fairly *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
24676:11	###I do n't think 0 \[ they can , \+ they can \] force another company to not drug test me just by *-1 saying that \[ I , \+ I \] did n't , I mean , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . 
24691:8	###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And since I was just , you know , one of the office folk , I guess 0 it *ICH*-1 was n't as important to them that they test me regularly . E_S 
24795:6	###But , of course , people are trapped *-1 economically E_S ###and they ca n't do that . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S 
24924:9	###if the industry comes hopefully they 'll promote good schools . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 .

30013:85	###SpeakerB16 . ###Do you use them frequently E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
30053:6	###SpeakerA31 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill . E_S ###That 's usually how we do it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB32 .

30110:19	###So , now , the only time 0 that got *-1 to be a problem *T*-2 was , if the exchange rate changed drastically . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
30372:6	###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh , definitely , E_S ###definitely . E_S 
30391:9	###just as quickly . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 .

31752:23	###I spent one winter in North Dakota , E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
31882:31	###I 'd walk into a room where some of that , N_S ###and I 'd wonder what is that *T*-1 , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###SpeakerB86 . 
32366:19	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###\[ and I , \+ and she \] moves it around ever other day . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . 
33687:9	###SpeakerB80 . ###Mostly into just walking and stuff like that . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###That 's probably the safer way E_S 
34834:8	###SpeakerA191 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but , well , \[ And , \+ and , \] of course , N_S ###SpeakerB192 . 
35715:111	###SpeakerB162 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's good . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . 
35733:56	###He said , You 're going *-1 to get a car that *T*-2 's got flood damage or hail damage . E_S ###And they just laughed at me . E_S ###And I went the next morning to Arlington , E_S ###and they gave it to me for that price . E_S

36696:6	###yeah , E_S ###we do n't really have a problem with that , um , in these areas , um , E_S ###and \[ even , \+ even \] when in Oklahoma when we camped *T*-1 I really did n't notice a problem with bugs . E_S ###And I noticed that , N_S

36941:17	###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###I believe 0 Communism is very much waning . E_S ###It 's , uh , pretty much on the way out of the door , insofar as the strong hold that they used *-2 to have *T*-1 , E_S 
36954:33	###SpeakerA15 . ###and that has n't set too well with their diplomacy \[ for the , \+ regarding the , \] uh , outcome of their affairs . E_S ###What 's your synopsis *T*-1 ? . E_S ###SpeakerB16 .

37034:19	###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's probably more true than , a lot of people realize . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
37300:6	###SpeakerB72 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] hope that they will change uh , E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] I 'm , N_S ###I just , N_S

95509:16	###Yeah , E_S ###that 's the way 0 I looked at it *T*-1 . E_S ###If I had something 0 * to hide *T*-1 , it 's one thing , E_S ###but I 'm , N_S

96891:28	###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . 
97488:11	###SpeakerB154 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###SpeakerB156 . 
97687:8	###The ones that , uh , *T*-1 go along with that , they are sure of themselves . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA81 .

98639:20	###SpeakerB45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###It 's what information *T*-1 is presented *-2 E_S 
98719:41	###SpeakerA17 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . 
98807:34	###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###and , uh , you know , they 'll wear it with a nice top . E_S 
98843:37	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . 
99175:13	###and it is a smaller size E_S ###and , uh , I do feel like there are a lot of options . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's , \] N_S ###but , I had been hoping 
99244:39	###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
99422:35	###SpeakerB66 . ###But it was , yeah , just lots of little lakes E_S ###and , of course , it *EXP*-1 was , you know , a little more expensive * to live on the lake , E_S ###but I just thought 0 that was grand . E_S 
99696:11	###and \[ how much , \+ how much \] we have reduced our waste . You know , that \[ we , \+ we 're \] generating *T*-1 a week *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
99791:31	###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###You know , MUMBLEx , um , I read \[ \[ a book one time \+ or a m- , \] \+ a magazine \] article E_S 
100012:36	###bad , uh , nutrition on top of it . E_S ###And , uh , she got to the point 0 she did n't want *-1 to alone anymore . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
100078:10	###so they were almost , you know , to the point of *-1 saying she ca n't be here anymore . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
100106:6	###you know , * go to the dining room \[ and , \+ and \] eat some good meals . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
100222:6	###What *ICH*-1 does that house got *T*-2 attraction ? E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Well , they fear *-1 being dependent on somebody . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . 
100340:16	###Well , I think 0 sometimes through groups and organizations , um , N_S ###\[ \[ \[ my first , \+ when I first thought of it *T*-1 , \] \+ I thought 0 it , \] \+ uh , when they asked the question *T*-2 I thought , \] well that sounds wonderful .

100388:8	###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###One of the calls 0 I 'd gotten *T*-1 before was , uh , down to Austin E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] I know , 0 a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest E_S 
100469:6	###SpeakerB75 . ###That 's probably true . E_S ###That 's probably true . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . 
101501:47	###because \[ I , \+ when I \] make this chicken casserole *T*-2 \[ \[ I , \+ it , \] \+ it \] makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . 
101971:6	###And * educating , uh , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###* Changing people 's expectations . E_S ###SpeakerA108 . 
102710:25	###\[ You have , \+ you have \] *-1 to expect *-2 to wait at least an hour . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
103023:8	###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh , the air pollution is n't too bad in our area . E_S ###So , we 're very fortunate 
103126:11	###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###But , uh , solar , of course , would be \[ the clean , \+ the cleanest . \] E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
103222:6	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###And so , if we can raise \[ it , \+ \] uh , you know , generations with those concerns , we 'll solve a lot of our problems . E_S ###I 'm afraid , N_S 
103331:27	###Yeah . ###Well I can underst- N_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###SpeakerB41 . 
103338:50	###\[ but \+ uh , you know , but \] that would be a situation where if somebody 0 you know *T*-1 was gon *-2 na be , you know N_S ###\[ \[ you \+ you \] \+ you \] really throw a lot *ICH*-1 on the courts , hopefully that they wo n't do that you know \[ for any \+ for any \] situation really . E_S ###But , uh , you know , when \[ I , \+ you \] find somebody just like that situation *T*-1 ###, I mean , it was disgusting when I read about it today *T*-2 . E_S 
103384:18	###That 's true . E_S ###You know , I just recently moved to Massachusetts . E_S ###I 'm not sure what their policy is *T*-1 on capital punishment E_S ###and that was one of the questions E_S 
103486:8	###SpeakerB95 . ###And , \[ \[ it , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] really scary . E_S ###I me- , you know , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what the perfect solution to that is *T*-1 E_S 
103511:151	###SpeakerA102 . ###SpeakerB103 . ###\[ So , \+ but , \] uh , you know , I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] struggle with it , E_S 
103511:204	###SpeakerA102 . ###SpeakerB103 . ###\[ So , \+ but , \] uh , you know , I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] struggle with it , E_S 
103885:21	###no , E_S ###I did n't think that anybody had those at all yet . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Well , maybe they do n't . E_S 
104036:118	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###well , N_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
104195:6	###SpeakerB40 . ###Which *T*-1 was an interesting movie , but not very funny . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S 
104265:24	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
104289:6	###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###That seems *-1 to happen . E_S 
104308:21	###Course , it 's so expensive *ICH*-1 , now , too that you ca n't hardly afford it . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . 
104627:77	###so I really , you know , just , N_S ###I can see that it will be a very long time , probably , before I subscribe to any magazines at home . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right . E_S 
104933:66	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
105027:26	###Uh , about the only memories that I have *T*-1 of boating , uh , N_S ###my husband 's family had \[ a , \+ a \] motor boat , uh , when we got engaged *-2 *T*-1 E_S ###and they took us out on the lake several times . E_S ###And , uh , I really did enjoy that . E_S 
105163:8	###SpeakerB24 . ###Yes . E_S ###We went years ago . E_S ###We have n't been *?* lately E_S 
105194:8	###And I 'm kind of anxious for that , E_S ###but , uh , yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . 
105197:6	###SpeakerA33 . ###Did you know that next week there 's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###No , E_S 
105448:11	###and I think 0 just the idea \[ that \+ you know that \] you may be tested *-1 might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you 're , N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
105535:8	###and if they need *-1 to do that as a condition for employment N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
105536:6	###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###and I know 0 many of them are doing it . E_S 
105574:11	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
106208:8	###but when she does *T*-1 \[ there , \+ \] a nurse is right there * to help her E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
106246:8	###so , you know , you 'd have *-1 to hire someone if you needed *-2 to paint inside your house or something E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
106262:32	###Oh , well , what kind of paint did you use *T*-1 for the , um , bookends ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , \[ \[ it 's , \+ uh , it , \] \+ that 's \] half the problem right there is that \[ it was n't , \+ it was \] a oil base , E_S ###so I had *-1 to get , N_S 
106266:13	###and when I painted them *T*-1 , I did n't realize that we did n't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house . E_S ###So I \[ had it , \+ had it \] all over my hands . E_S ###At first I did n't realize , you know , N_S ###I had never painted anything , E_S 
106666:11	###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh , but that depends , you know , on the individual if they can I guess have self-control . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , that 's a lot of it . E_S 
106797:53	###you know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
106799:6	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And so , \[ that , \+ that 's \] the difference there where sometimes like I know 0 if we 've had an especially bad month and we 're just almost getting down to payday , then I think 0 if we could really budget *T*-1 , N_S ###we tried one tim- , N_S 
106823:86	###Well , \[ we , \+ we \] eat out a good deal at this point . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Do you ? E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
107033:6	###see we do n't have anything here in Belton . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] a pretty small little town . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah , E_S 
107308:15	###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . 
107457:6	###SpeakerB16 . ###Um , \[ \[ one thing that I- , \+ that I think \] \+ probably one of the reasons that \] people do n't vote more *T*-1 is because they do n't know the candidates . E_S ###And I think sometimes , you know , N_S ###that 's one thing that I have learned *T*-1 \[ in *-2 w- , \+ working in \] elections and things is , you know , 0 sometimes even when you work for someone *T*-3 you do n't really know what they 're like *T*-4 . E_S 
107608:8	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And , you know , just , you see a lot of things like \[ you , \+ you \] know , MUMBLEx was a great golfer and wanted *-1 to play golf when he retired *T*-2 , E_S 
107642:6	###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] a hard decision , E_S ###but I do n't think 0 I would do it to my parents personally . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I know at this , N_S 
109100:40	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###and , gosh , I 'm trying *-1 to think , E_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
109120:15	###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###I have a daughter in middle school , E_S 
109150:42	###so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Oh , my , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
109964:14	###this is kind of a , um , N_S ###\[ at , \+ at \] least here I 've noticed , N_S ###I 'm not from here , E_S ###I 'm from Colorado , E_S 
109976:8	###and I think 0 that 's really important \[ that , \+ that \] they do that E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
110170:9	###SpeakerB70 . ###And about how much are they *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Well , they range , N_S 
110416:6	###SpeakerA85 . ###goodness , E_S ###\[ \[ it , \+ it is , \] \+ it 's \] mind bog- , you know , well , you know , N_S ###I agree with you , E_S 
110539:6	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###SpeakerA36 . ###Yeah , E_S 
110864:31	###Still at it . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Well the explanation 0 I \[ was , \+ was \] given *-2 *T*-1 about , you know , N_S 
110876:6	###SpeakerB46 . ###Just , N_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . 
111140:9	###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###but \[ the , \+ the \] ice storms really are stressful on all \[ the , \+ the \] plants that we have *T*-1 around . E_S 
112602:68	###SpeakerB86 . ###Oh , my God . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###And so immediately she says , well , I ca n't have any confidence in them anymore , E_S 
112706:6	###SpeakerB32 . ###and someday I hope we can afford *-1 to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
112856:14	###SpeakerB4 . ###Well , I was from Illinois originally , E_S ###and I grew up *-1 a Bear fan . E_S ###And , uh , then we moved here E_S 
112876:6	###I think two . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Two . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
113371:110	###SpeakerB18 . ###I think that that \[ would , \+ would \] help a lot . E_S ###I guess 0 in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things , E_S ###but I do n't know . 
113683:11	###Well , yes . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , uh , and that 's an idea that *T*-1 's been \[ around for , \+ kicked *-2 around for \] a long time . E_S 
113704:32	###I believe 0 that 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
113790:42	###So at least that 's a step in the right direction I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###yeah . E_S 
113877:26	###There needs *-1 to be more of an open policy . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . 
114738:8	###SpeakerB66 . ###That 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###It really is *?* , E_S 
115354:11	###It 's \[ kind of , \+ kind of \] neat . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ what , \+ what \] does a computer club do *T*-1 . E_S 
115857:25	###but we 'll spend hundreds of thousands *RNR*-1 , if not millions *RNR*-1 , of dollars on . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . 
115937:6	###Uh , I used *-1 to live in the Plano school district , E_S ###and , uh , there was \[ \[ a , \+ an organization , \] \+ a taxpayers organization \] that , uh , *T*-3 finally communicated the message *ICH*-2 \[ to the , \+ I think to the \] people in Plano that , you know , we did n't want our taxes raised *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Yes , E_S 
117386:61	###* keep *-1 going . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###No , E_S ###it 's okay . E_S 
117486:6	###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###That 's great . E_S 
117576:11	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###And this is huge . E_S ###You know , course , when he runs around the yard *T*-1 , he just digs , E_S 
117694:13	###if our shoes sat side by side , she would pee in my husband 's shoes . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . 
117860:6	###Yeah , E_S ###I know . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###Actually , it 's my son , E_S 
118248:33	###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
118822:39	###this may be unfair to Mexico , E_S ###but it seems like there 's a lack of honesty \[ in , \+ in \] foreign policy a lot of the times . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh-huh , E_S 
119481:86	###but , gee , \[ this is , \+ of all the topics 0 I have had *T*-1 , I 'm doing this thing , this is \] kind of the strangest one *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###\[ I , \+ at first I \] thought of food , you know , because that 's \[ what , \+ mainly what \] I buy *T*-1 , E_S it seems like *T*-2 , E_S ###and , uh , you know , I still do n't have \[ any , \+ anything \] 0 *-1 to do *T*-2 there , E_S 
119634:8	###SpeakerB30 . ###and \[ that , \+ uh , it \] obviously is n't working . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Well , I think , uh , 0 it would n't hurt , E_S 
120930:11	###I think 0 it \[ can be , \+ can be \] managed *-1 by \[ less , \+ uh , less \] levels . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S 
120993:11	###but then they 'll raise it *ICH*-1 somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever . E_S ###It 's just , I mean , 0 you can see that your money is just not going that far . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S 
121132:11	###But , um , \[ those law- , \+ those lawns \] look nice during the winter , E_S ###but , you know , they almost stick out like \[ a , \+ I guess not a \] sore thumb , a pretty thumb . E_S ###But , you know , when you look at the neighborhoods *T*-1 \[ and \+ \] they 're all brown except the one , you know , E_S it 's sort of like , well , . N_S ###SpeakerA53 . 
121141:10	###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . 
121148:13	###it was raining continuously . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
121607:11	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Oh . E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] in Texas . E_S 
121736:63	###I think 0 it needs *-1 to be something , uh , uh , a throwback to where they did a , uh , public execution where it 's visible *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
121759:37	###I mean , they become well known . E_S ###They are almost \[ like , \+ like \] a big star . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###\[ Ye- , \+ yes , \] E_S 
121763:6	###\[ but , \+ but \] \[ they , \+ they \] know that their chances of * actually receiving the death penalty are minimal . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
121853:22	###SpeakerA57 . ###Do they deserve *-1 to , uh , remain on this earth too ? E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Why , you know , \[ \[ y- , \+ y- , \] \+ you \] could carry it to that \[ if , \+ uh , if \] they are a repeat offender E_S 
122340:6	###SpeakerB2 . ###SpeakerA3 . ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , that might be a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it . E_S 
122403:21	###I mean , they 've so severely limited E_S what disciplinary action you can do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S 
122431:6	###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And a lot of his problems had *-1 to do with money mostly . E_S 
122441:6	###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Then if you do n't have qualified teachers in the different MUMBLEx , N_S 
122461:6	###Right . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###\[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ maybe \] they should sit back \[ and , \+ and \] kind of , uh , decide on where the money 's best spent *-1 *T*-2 . E_S

162192:8	###Uh , I think 0 the Japanese really build good cars E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
162983:21	###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###How lucky . E_S 
163232:45	###Now , I firmly believe in that E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###None of this , N_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
163325:9	###and so \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not really familiar . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
163360:39	###Uh , I bought some Cokes *ICH*-1 the other day in \[ the br- , \+ the little bottles \] you know , E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
163395:11	###yeah . E_S ###It 's amazing . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Well , out in this area , they really do n't have anything . E_S 
163402:26	###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . 
163410:6	###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah E_S ###it 's , N_S 
163632:9	###Steve , uh , with the election year and whatnot coming up , do you think 0 we ought *-1 to cut taxes , raise them , E_S ###\[ \[ or , \+ or , \] \+ or \] what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a really hard question . E_S 
163638:15	###* let 's example , uh , N_S ###our friend , the President , right now , says no new taxes , E_S ###we should and especially , if anything , be cutting taxes now because of the recession E_S ###and at the same time , the budget 0 he sent *T*-1 to Congress has tax and fee increases , E_S 
163669:6	###\[ and , \+ and \] they just have n't *?* yet . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###I 'm not exactly sure , uh , about polio in particular . E_S 
163718:6	###Pork barrel politics . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Pork barrel politics . E_S ###\[ \[ The- , \+ the- , \] \+ there \] has *-1 to be some way 0 * to do it *T*-2 . E_S 
163919:57	###\[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it 's \] the artist , not the merit . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah , E_S ###exactly . E_S 
164112:13	###I was surprised , uh , E_S ###so * happened 0 this person worked at the same place , E_S ###I work for Georgia Tech E_S ###and they work at the same place 0 I did *T*-1 , E_S 
164181:6	###SpeakerA27 . ###something that *T*-1 will carry it around careful , I guess 0 *T*-3 is \[ best , \+ best \] way 0 * to describe it *T*-2 . E_S ###Right now , we 've got a V six E_S ###and \[ it , \+ that \] seems *-1 to be just fine . E_S 
164255:10	###SpeakerA53 . ###and , uh , they have \[ a , \+ a \] child that *T*-1 's five years old E_S ###and it 's really handy for * hauling him *ICH*-1 around \[ and , \+ and \] their stuff , E_S ###and , of course , as he gets friends , I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 that will be even handier . E_S 
164277:8	###uh , again , like you , if conditions \[ are , \+ are \] that bad , I probably do n't want *-1 to be driving anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
164391:12	###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Then , you know , there 's been guys in jail for six years E_S 
164447:6	###SpeakerB62 . ###I do n't think 0 you 'll ever stop all that stuff dead , E_S ###but , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ y- , \] \+ y- , \] \+ you \] might be able *-1 to , uh , stop people , you know , E_S ###they 're thinking about it , E_S 
164552:30	###* Have *-1 to agree with you , E_S ###and I 'm kind of \[ i- , \+ in \] favor of capital punishment also . E_S ###I just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because , uh , you still see them committing the same crimes , E_S ###but , I tend *-1 to agree with you that , uh , we should have it . E_S 
164585:6	###SpeakerB44 . ###but I think , N_S ###I do n't know because , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . 
164661:11	###not sure \] N_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] in Washington , D C or at least very close to it . E_S ###I 'm not sure what kind of , uh , capital punishment we have *T*-1 here . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . 
165375:8	###but , \[ the brakes , \+ I was really surprised that the brakes \] . N_S ###I wanted , N_S ###I do have the background . E_S ###I know what *T*-1 needs *-2 to be done *-3 E_S 
165920:13	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh , I 've been real impressed with that . E_S ###Yo- , N_S 
166025:23	###SpeakerB6 . ###And they only have one set of recycling bins , one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters . E_S ###So a lot of the people who *T*-1 live up front do n't bother *-2 to recycle because , you know , it *EXP*-3 's too far * to carry the stuff to the other bins . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
166068:8	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ Th- , \+ there \] definitely has *-1 to be a motivation factor E_S 
166295:8	###SpeakerB12 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I mean , \[ I , \+ I 've \] seen so many different things . \[ So , \+ so \] many different bad reports coming out of the school system E_S 
166521:94	###SpeakerB54 . ###\[ and \+ but , \] N_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , I think 0 they 're starting *-1 to realize that . E_S 
166763:6	###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh , the thing 0 I do n't like *T*-1 , N_S 
166933:11	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###they \[ have \+ can \] look after a lot of things E_S ###but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able *-1 to deal with *T*-2 physically anymore . E_S 
167084:32	###But when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going *-1 to lay *T*-2 down *T*-3 , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] they should *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
167126:28	###and \[ whe- , \+ whether \] or not you agree with that law , \[ i- , \+ you 're \] still circumventing it . E_S ###You are legal \[ in , \+ in \] your circumvention of that law . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###\[ What , \+ what \] if you 're not doing it in order *-1 to circumvent the law though ? E_S 
167189:8	###SpeakerA24 . ###\[ if , \+ if \] I 'm a computer consulting firm and I see \[ these , \+ this \] great deal on forty-six mother boards , uh , \[ from , \+ from \] say Utah . E_S Um , \[ I , \+ I \] might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have *-1 to pay Pennsylvania sales tax . E_S ###My \[ a- , \+ accounting \] department will at the end of the month . E_S ###\[ I think that \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ I think 0 that 's \] the way 0 things work in Pennsylvania *T*-1 . E_S 
167197:141	###SpeakerA26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###So , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer . E_S 
167301:11	###But if you 're involved yourself , personally N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
167857:48	###Uh , although I I 'm sure 0 to some extent , that money is part of the problem in the disparity , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###but \[ I do n't think , \+ I honestly do n't think \] 0 that 's the biggest part of it . E_S 
168909:8	###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###and I do n't know , E_S ###I do n't know \[ how much the stuff actually , \+ what they actually have *T*-1 \] in there E_S 
168919:14	###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that was , \+ \[ that , \+ that \] was \] the other one 0 I was thinking of *T*-1 . E_S ###I think 0 that 's , uh , N_S 
168998:48	###not a huge part but a , you know N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###A growing part . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
169134:11	###So , um , how do you feel about the crime in your city *T*-1 ? E_S ###Is it , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , um , Minneapolis is n't too bad . E_S 
169231:6	###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###So they wait while you 're \[ out , \+ outdoors . \] E_S 
169331:27	###One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . 
169355:58	###SpeakerA89 . ###It is n't *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###No . E_S 
169459:35	###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
169808:21	###Uh-huh . E_S ###So what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 they 're very accurate E_S 
169809:8	###So what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 they 're very accurate E_S ###because , I mean , I know 0 their lifestyles changed \[ p- , \+ prior \] to the drug test E_S 
169814:11	###SpeakerA11 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###See I know of that too . E_S 
169850:10	###SpeakerA19 . ###The accuracy ? E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S 
170151:38	###And that worked out real well cause we did n't have *-1 to keep *-2 writing down what we 'd spent *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
170251:14	###SpeakerA55 . ###I mean you buy \[ a , \+ a \] tenderloin steak , it costs outrageous , like twelve dollars a pound . E_S ###You buy \[ a , \+ a , \] less than half a pound ###so it 's six or seven dollars . E_S 
170553:9	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . ###Yeah . E_S 
170630:31	###They sell their house , E_S ###they stash away a good bit of money and come down here E_S ###and I work with a lot of them , E_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] think 0 \[ they , \+ they \] have really done something . E_S 
170783:8	###and that 's the only reason , you know , 0 I go to him *T*-1 because I know him E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
170848:9	###If they 're equipped *-1 *-1 \[ too , \+ to \] handle the kind of patients 0 you 're going *-3 to have *T*-2 you know , put *-4 in there too . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . 
170894:52	###SpeakerB26 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###That 's what my grandparents , N_S 
171298:11	###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###So . And I do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S 
171461:57	###SpeakerB6 . ###even , despite , you know , diligent washing , \[ it , \+ it \] got rusty after about , uh , three weeks of use . E_S ###And I do n't think 0 it was my fault because \[ \[ i- , \+ I , \] \+ you know , I \] had made a point of like * drying it off and cleaning it E_S ###but , uh , \[ it was really , \+ uh , it was , \] N_S 
172178:9	###so . I agree that that should be encouraged *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
172730:34	###They may have , uh , just plain parental leave , which either one can take *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . 
172848:6	###How much of your resource should you dedicate *T*-1 to , uh , * making things work for others ?

E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , well yeah . E_S 
173648:15	###Uh , a lot of companies now \[ are , \+ are \] using , uh , drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations * \[ to , \+ to \] root out \[ the , \+ the \] either , uh , elementary or intermediate or advanced , uh , drug users . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
173737:24	###But , yeah , E_S ###get , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah . E_S 
174253:40	###About the only good thing 0 I would say *T*-1 about that is \[ 0 it w- , \+ that it would , \] uh , hurry the process up a bit E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . 
174913:30	###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###You know , I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested *-1 for Honeywell *T*-2 E_S 
175101:13	###They 're pretty good . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Well , that 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
175101:34	###They 're pretty good . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Well , that 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
175204:28	###there is no * denying \[ that , \+ that , \] E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Sure , you know . E_S 
175358:50	###and I understand that the jails are full of people , you know , uh and that they have *-1 to do something . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
175493:20	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And , uh , they do n't let me know really about anything that *T*-1 's going on . E_S ###Even some of the immediate things that I need *-1 to know *T*-2 , I do n't know it until the next hour E_S 
175619:13	###and it *EXP*-1 's real hard * \[ to , \+ to \] tell them , you know , that you 're not interested . E_S ###Or you do tell them 0 you 're not interested E_S ###and they still keep *-1 asking you , you know , and keep *-1 badgering you about it , E_S ###and that aggravates me . E_S 
176453:15	###and she just screams . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . 
176553:74	###SpeakerA60 . ###* Guess so , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB61 .
