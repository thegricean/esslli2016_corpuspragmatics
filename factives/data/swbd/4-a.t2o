1890:6	###It was in J F K Stadium , if I can remember . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh man . E_S ###SpeakerA81 .

2731:30	###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###If they 're just going *-1 to be meeting with T I -ers like * to talk about a patent kind of thing and \[ the , \+ they 're \] engineers that they 're talking too *T*-2 , they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed *T*-3 E_S

4289:18	###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and perhaps , it 's because somehow that implies to me 0 it 's not fun , or something like that . E_S 
4425:15	###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . 
4492:34	###SpeakerA91 . ###Boy , E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Do you think 0 the program came first or the , N_S

5244:21	###I said * did n't . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###That was a good ###MUMBLEx . N_S

6228:63	###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And that 's certainly one of the reasons that I 'm sure 0 *T*-2 that they 've begun the , uh , CODA Plan *T*-1 . E_S

6661:6	###he was in C C C during , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
7087:97	###SpeakerA86 . ###That much stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###SpeakerA88 . 
7145:35	###And I play the organ sometimes , uh , just for my own satisfaction . Not for anybody else 's ears E_S ###because I 'm not that good at it , E_S ###but I like *-1 to bang on the keyboards once in a while . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
7416:6	###SpeakerB94 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###I enjoyed *-1 speaking with you E_S 
7506:9	###SpeakerA24 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###and when things start , uh , N_S 
7775:16	###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . 
8059:32	###and I said , okay , I want *-1 to see a curriculum guide , you know , E_S so I 'll know what I 'm suppose *-2 to teach *T*-3 E_S ###and they go , we do n't have one . E_S ###We do n't even know where one is *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . 
8353:8	###So it took him about two and a half years , E_S ###but , uh , he built us a house , E_S ###it 's , uh , N_S ###we have thirty-two hundred square feet , E_S 
8441:23	###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###oh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
8740:23	###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###So , I bought him an alarm clock . E_S 
8774:11	###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###that effects the budget especially around , uh , Christmas time E_S 
8921:6	###I think 0 she made three *ICH*-1 this year one for , uh , my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters . E_S ###So , those things they take some time 0 * to make *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S 
9187:9	###but I do think that , um , Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
9218:53	###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###And , uh , I do n't know how long \[ that , \+ that \] will take *T*-1 . E_S 
9224:19	###So , if you do n't want *-1 to burn coal for power , how about \[ nucle- , \+ nuclear \] energy . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
9328:42	###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] a lot warmer , a lot drier too , because usually about this time of year , \[ this , \+ \] you know , you see a little bit more rain .

9336:9	###SpeakerA7 . ###But it , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###terrible ice storm , uh , around this time of the year . E_S

9464:6	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh it does n't , N_S 
9807:31	###SpeakerA107 . ###My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB108 . 
9864:11	###SpeakerB126 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I think 0 they 're \[ doing it , \+ trying *-1 to do it , \] \+ or I hope 0 they 're trying *-2 to do it \] all over the country , because they need *-3 to collect all kinds of \[ different \+ different \] dialects . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . 
9907:6	###the people there have money , E_S ###that 's not their problem , E_S ###but there 's no food 0 for them to buy *T*-1 , E_S ###and it 's , N_S 
9979:19	###SpeakerA12 . ###Uh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###But , I think 0 they 're doing better . E_S 
10471:14	###\[ \[ We , \+ we- , \] \+ I \] had one \[ \[ that *T*-1 had , \+ 0 we had , \] \+ 0 we had \] *-3 to put *T*-2 to sleep he got so sick . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . 
10694:6	###SpeakerB154 . ###Oh , goodness . E_S ###You get so attached to them . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . 
11239:65	###so . N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S 
11321:6	###but for newspaper . N_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . 
11631:14	###SpeakerA65 . ###No E_S ###it was n't *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . 
11837:8	###they 're swinging wider so that now they are coming \[ over , \+ over \] our homes . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
11863:6	###Um , it 's interesting E_S ###because in order *-4 to , uh , keep with the E P A standards \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-1 tend *-2 to be visible , uh , what *T*-3 's coming out of your smokestack , they do all their emissions at night . E_S ###Uh , so people get up , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
12419:40	###but I think 0 we were genuinely concerned about \[ how , \+ \] their military capability E_S ###and \[ we , \+ uh , I think 0 we \] over estimated it , E_S ###but still , we were really , highly concerned about it E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
12462:10	###SpeakerB46 . ###No , uh , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I did hear that at one time a long time ago , E_S ###SpeakerA47 . 
13153:6	###SpeakerB251 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA252 . ###Yeah . E_S 
13379:8	###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###they just , you know , start *-1 going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers , E_S

13414:8	###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###And , uh , I think 0 those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy . E_S 
13449:6	###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###even if friends call it irritates me . E_S 
13529:58	###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###And so \[ it 's , \+ you know , it \] makes it convenient . E_S 
13581:6	###I remember *-1 reading in the paper a few months back E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Yeah , E_S 
13759:11	###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
13772:192	###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] you were paying for really high quality care . E_S

14094:8	###SpeakerA25 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . 
14340:6	###and then somebody got injured *-1 E_S ###and he was supposed *-1 to go . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###I 'm not sure . E_S

45006:9	###now then they had the voting machines E_S ###and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yes . E_S 
45090:18	###Uh , they can declare anything 0 they want *T*-1 E_S ###and they can actually rig it .

46217:6	###Um , it 's kind of a concern for me , E_S ###in fact , at the moment I 'm thinking of *-1 possibly moving to a new apartment E_S ###and , uh , it 's , N_S ###I am single and female , E_S 
46483:11	###and they really enforce it , E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] believe in the death penalty , E_S ###I really do . E_S

47362:6	###and that , um , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I heard a joke *ICH*-1 on the radio yesterday \[ that , \+ in regard that \] he did n't design the patriot missile system , E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
47495:8	###we did go to a baseball game last year .

E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
47553:6	###I rarely go E_S ###but we went last year E_S ###because \[ my brother , \+ my brother \] is impossible , when , um , ###he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff , E_S 
47792:8	###but , um , it 's kind of a different situation because you 're probably living in an apartment , right ? E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , that makes a really big difference . E_S 
47961:11	###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . 
48277:23	###only the guns were in the hands of the criminals , E_S ###but how many times , N_S ###I guess 0 I have never heard of \[ a , \+ a \] robbery being foiled *-1 or spoiled *-1 because the person who *T*-2 's being robbed *-3 had a gun . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
48374:23	###but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks . That 's kind of scary to me E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Oh , sure . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
48523:11	###but it 's just 0 \[ y- , \+ you \] have , *-1 to have a need . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###You have *-1 to make yourself do it , E_S ###yeah . E_S 
48831:6	###and that 's probably the way 0 I feel *T*-4 about it \[ is , \+ is , \] uh , it kind of depends on the crime that *T*-2 's committed *-3 . E_S ###My belief all my life , I guess 0 *T*-1 , has been \[ that , \+ that \] if you take someone else 's life , then you automatically are giving up , uh , yours in place of it .

50628:31	###SpeakerB206 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA207 . ###and , uh , things just kept *-1 changing so much E_S 
50814:11	###I personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
50845:28	###But I do n't know what organization it 's under *T*-1 . E_S ###I do n't know if it 's a government run *RNR*-2 *RNR*-3 or if it 's a private *RNR*-2 *RNR*-3 charity that *T*-1 's put it together . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###I do n't either . E_S 
50851:8	###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###out here in California , there 's a program like that for , uh , juvenile delinquents , ###\[ the , \+ the \] ones that *T*-1 are not dangerous E_S 
50869:11	###but there may be other things . E_S ###I 'm not so sure what kind of , uh , training *ICH*-2 that is *T*-1 for the future for those kids . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S 
51016:21	###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###That 's no secret , E_S 
51106:42	###And they say , uh-huh , because they really do n't want *-1 to pay for a service that *T*-2 's not being done *-3 properly either . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . 
51590:11	###And then they , N_S ###almost all of them had a Montessori section . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Huh . E_S 
51657:66	###SpeakerB104 . ###SpeakerA105 . ###SpeakerB106 . ###SpeakerA107 . 
52051:6	###but usually I do n't . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###what type of movies do you like *T*-1 ? E_S 
52244:6	###but I just have never been a Stallone fan . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Yo , Adrian . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . 
52453:6	###and they pushed it back , to *-1 playing it in the theaters until like August , E_S ###SpeakerA148 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB149 . 
52679:11	###and I 'm sure 0 they hit a few every now and then , E_S ###and I would n't want *-1 to be one of them , that *T*-2 are not guilty . E_S ###But , I know that they have like , uh , their , crime rate , E_S ###it 's not Jamaica , E_S I do n't think 0 *T*-1 , E_S

54374:6	###SpeakerA74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###But , I do n't know , E_S 
54771:6	###SpeakerA118 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ um , I \] wish 0 , \[ I , \+ I \] mean I 'd seen it \[ when , \+ when , \] you know , it was originally in the theaters *T*-1 E_S ###and , um , \[ I saw it , \+ you know , I saw \] part of it again . E_S 
55330:59	###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###But , during that same time frame , did n't you get some feeling , that , I mean , they 're getting all these weapons and stuff ? E_S 
55359:23	###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh , the ones to the south are more regional conflict . E_S ###They 're not really that worried about * invading north . E_S ###They 're more interested in , N_S 
55606:8	###I mean \[ it 's just , \+ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \] not a question of whether I want *-1 to *?* , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerA71 . 
55771:6	###SpeakerA133 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###But usually , when I go into the hot tub *T*-1 before I go *-2 swimming , or when I come out *T*-3 , I 'm totally relaxed when I go home *T*-4 . E_S

56116:73	###SpeakerB102 . ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] right , because , N_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Of course , that 's probably blasphemy 0 for you to say *T*-3 , uh , *-2 coming from where you are *T*-1 in Texas . E_S

59572:119	###SpeakerA85 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not , that 's another trip , E_S

60090:9	###and he counted the fish E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
60541:6	###but , you know , as you get *-1 to know more of the people that *T*-2 work there and more of what *T*-3 's going on with the system , N_S ###so I was in the computer operations E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ uh , you know , it all starts \] *-1 to become similar E_S ###\[ there 's , \+ you know , there 's \] benefits E_S

79986:6	###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I think , too . N_S

84943:6	###and I do quite a bit of business in Washington . E_S ###And , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###I mean you know what it 's like *T*-1 here . N_S

93468:18	###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###So you look at it more as a task . E_S ###SpeakerA29 .

93649:22	###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###SpeakerA99 . 
94317:47	###SpeakerA109 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and this year they 're all excited . E_S ###The show this weekend , N_S

95406:104	###SpeakerA76 . ###Personnel , or something , E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###SpeakerA78 . 
95509:16	###so it 's not as big a deal , E_S ###and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much *T*-1 whether they 're really concerned about their rights , or whether they 're really concerned about something else . E_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###Right . E_S 
96245:20	###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###because , it used *-1 to be 0 they were draftsman . E_S

98639:20	###but often juries hear only a fraction \[ of the , \+ of the \] story when they have *-1 to decide guilt or innocence *T*-2 .

99244:39	###but it certainly , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
99422:35	###but there was quite a few lakes all around there . E_S ###\[ It seemed like , \+ it was almost like \] you were living on an island E_S ###there was so much water around where I was *T*-1 . E_S ###I said 0 I was n't close to downtown Pontiac , E_S 
99696:11	###They were real upset E_S ###but \[ they were n't , \+ they were \] only picking up once a week . E_S ###And we said to them , if you recycle , MUMBLEx \[ you 'll , \+ you know , you 'll \] go two weeks without *-1 having *-2 to put out the green container . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
99791:31	###it seems like a small contribution E_S ###but it 's not *?* . E_S ###If everyone were *-1 to recycle just their newspapers , they would \[ s- , \+ save \] thousands and thousands of trees \[ a day . \+ A day , \] just from *-2 not throwing out your newspapers . E_S ###SpeakerB94 .

100078:10	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And , uh , you know the type of facilities whether it 's a shared room or two separate rooms that *T*-1 share uh , a , uh , bathroom . 
100106:6	###I mean , very antisocial . E_S ###Maybe it *EXP*-1 takes a while for them to say , okay , well I 'll be with other people E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA59 .

103126:11	###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , oddly enough I thought 0 our part of the country was ideal . E_S

103384:18	###SpeakerB61 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah , E_S 
103486:8	###For instance , I mean , that 's just , N_S ###I could see capital punishment in a case like that . And , you know , \[ for , \+ for \] other people , too , that *T*-1 do things , like that . E_S ###But , uh , when , N_S ###uh , my wife and I are both participating in this survey E_S

104933:66	###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###And I think 0 they 've had it for several years . E_S 
105027:26	###but , uh , we did some water skiing *ICH*-1 , of course , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * driving around the lake in the boat ###\[ and , \+ and \] just the basic safety rules and things I found *T*-1 real interesting .

105194:8	###SpeakerB34 . ###No , E_S ###I know 0 this is a real good time 0 * to go *T*-1 , because they are having so many activities and special shows . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
105197:6	###SpeakerA35 . ###Well , and with a daughter , nine , it is just , N_S ###she 's old enough * to really grasp the meaning behind , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
105448:11	###because I think 0 they may put them into some sort of a program 0 *T*-1 to get them off of drugs . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
105535:8	###I know 0 my son has had *-1 to do it for both Sam 's and Wal-Mart E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 .

105574:11	###SpeakerA73 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###SpeakerA75 . 
106208:8	###and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her *T*-1 , E_S ###so . It *ICH*-2 became dangerous for us * to keep *-1 transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yep . E_S 
106246:8	###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And the second one was 0 I bought some toys \[ at a , \+ um , at a \] craft fair . E_S 
106262:32	###So I \[ had it , \+ had it \] all over my hands . E_S ###At first I did n't realize , you know , N_S ###I had never painted anything , E_S ###so I did n't realize that I needed that . E_S 
106266:13	###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###I mean , I kind of knew , in the back of my mind , E_S 
106666:11	###One time we tried something that *T*-1 really worked E_S ###but we did n't keep it up . E_S ###I passed it on to a friend E_S ###and she wo n't quit *-1 doing it . E_S

106799:6	###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . 
106823:86	###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
107033:6	###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###And , uh , N_S 
107308:15	###And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home E_S ###so , um , we 've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . 
107457:6	###and when they got in office *T*-1 it was just a disaster . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
107608:8	###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###But he refuses *-1 to consider any other , E_S 
107642:6	###But \[ I , \+ I \] really feel bad for the people 0 I see *T*-1 th- , ###not very , N_S ###I 'm not \[ really , \+ really \] experienced E_S ###but like I said I just have that one family , E_S 
109100:40	###but she also has ten children . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ What , \+ what \] grade do you teach *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB38 .

E_S 
109150:42	###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###I 'm a slow mover * to say the least , E_S 
109964:14	###that N_S ###men do n't treat you like you do n't know anything , * generally speaking . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S 
109976:8	###and , um , I do n't know , E_S ###I found 0 when I did do some work *T*-1 when my son was young *T*-2 , it was like contract work , E_S ###and it was n't where I had *-1 to be there every day *T*-2 , E_S ###but , I mean , we were going to the doctor once a week , E_S 
110170:9	###They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars , I think 0 *T*-2 which I thought 0 *T*-1 was a lot . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###\[ And how about the , \+ And how about the \] person in , uh , Houston ? E_S ###SpeakerA73 . 
110416:6	###same problems the same , uh , good qualities as anybody else . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
110539:6	###I said , who ever I talk to *T*-1 is going *-2 to be board , because when it 's summer time *T*-3 , I 'm wearing shorts , E_S ###and when it 's cold *T*-1 , I 'm wearing sweat pants , \[ and most of , \+ \] unless I 'm going to something special that my daughter 's doing *T*-2 , or something like that , E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S 
110864:31	###but they did n't have the money 0 * to restructure *T*-1 , E_S ###but * looks to me that it would n't take really that much money * to at least come up with , I mean , some kind of partitions you know , E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Partitions E_S 
110876:6	###SpeakerB48 . ###Oh , goodness . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###so he spent all day in this one large open area , E_S 
111140:9	###SpeakerB65 . ###Really , E_S ###oh do they . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . 
112602:68	###SpeakerB88 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###But one of the teachers happened *-1 to walk by and see her pounding on the window *-2 trying *-3 to get out of the bus . E_S 
112706:6	###and I used *-1 to live in Colorado , oh , sometime ago for a couple of years , E_S ###and I really enjoyed that . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
112856:14	###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And we had some wonderful , wonderful years there under Roger Staubach . E_S 
112876:6	###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###But they 're not doing bad . E_S ###People are pretty surprised that \[ they , \+ I mean they \] beat the Giants . E_S 
113371:110	###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###And , uh , * seems like some rather large chunks of money could come \[ from , \+ from \] that direction . E_S 
113683:11	###But , uh , I believe 0 Israel does that , do n't they for their , N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , yes , E_S ###I think so . 
113704:32	###SpeakerA9 . ###No , E_S ###I do n't think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \[ necessa- , \+ n- , \] N_S ###I think of that . N_S 
113790:42	###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 you 're right that that 's \[ not the , \+ not the \] way that the society these days is going *T*-1 , E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ we need *-1 to , \+ we need *-2 to \] try *-3 to figure out some way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] turn that around *T*-4 that everybody , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###\[ It 's really , \+ it 's really \] unfortunate because when you do , N_S

114738:8	###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###But , uh , you know , you learn something every time 0 you use it *T*-1 . E_S 
115354:11	###SpeakerB30 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###just all over the place . E_S ###They just get around \[ and , \+ and \] talk techy \[ or , \+ or \] else , uh , uh , you know , N_S 
115857:25	###but , it could be put *-1 to more practical use . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] think that , uh , it *ICH*-1 's \[ a , \+ a \] tone of our times that politicians , uh , are into themselves more than they are into , you know , *-2 doing something worthwhile for the people 0 they represent *T*-3 , which *T*-4 is really unfortunate . E_S 
115937:6	###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Yes . E_S 
117386:61	###And one of the things 0 we try *-2 to do *T*-1 is we try *-3 to avoid *-4 doing that as much as possible . Although it *EXP*-5 really is very easy * to do that type of thing .

117486:6	###And I think 0 we probably will *?* soon as the boys get a little bit older . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA87 .

117694:13	###SpeakerA65 . ###Or the smell or something . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Oh , anyway , \[ I , \+ I , \] N_S 
117860:6	###SpeakerA135 . ###SpeakerB136 . ###My older boy . He never likes *-1 to come home from school . E_S ###Anyway that 's what we have *T*-1 , E_S 
118248:33	###SpeakerB8 . ###You were *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###and the discipline that my daughter receives *T*-1 now in *-2 going to school is just totally different . E_S 
118822:39	###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###The big problem with the United States is 0 we have our basic nine to five schedule you know , E_S 
119481:86	###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###so . N_S 
119634:8	###but , uh , you 're right , E_S ###there 's just too many issues that *T*-1 come up that , uh , our senators and our congressmen vote on *T*-2 simply because it 's a Democratic issue or it 's a Republican issue E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S 
120930:11	###I work with the state , E_S ###and any time 0 \[ there 's , \+ there is \] a budget cut or crunches *T*-2 , it 's always the small guy \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 gets hurt . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Right . E_S 
120993:11	###but they changed the , uh , deductions on you , E_S ###and that just raises your taxes , you know , ###they just get it a different way E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
121132:11	###and , uh , you know , they just grow rocks E_S ###and MUMBLEx . That 's their gardening there . ###So , uh , I guess as long as you can have , uh , some grass there . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
121141:10	###and we were taking care of lawns out there , E_S ###and , uh , that particular year they had just tons of rain , you know , E_S ###it was raining continuously . E_S ###SpeakerB58 .

143814:8	###SpeakerA40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###SpeakerA42 .

144671:15	###SpeakerB148 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###But it probably takes a lot . E_S

157975:16	###but actually I 'm getting a call . E_S ###I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting . E_S ###Could I ask you *-1 to hold one minute ? E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
158121:8	###but \[ it 's , \+ I really think 0 it 's \] true for our family , E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Wel- , N_S ###SpeakerB76 . 
158169:11	###but I really do think 0 sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children E_S ###and \[ they , \+ they \] learn *-1 to share . E_S ###They learn *-1 not necessarily to be the center of attention ###but that at the same time we have *-2 to be sure 0 they are secure . E_S 
159036:44	###SpeakerA95 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###SpeakerA97 . 
159050:15	###or maybe it was on the radi- , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Um , are you working right now ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . 
159127:8	###You know , they 'll let you work halftime \[ if you want *-1 to , \+ if you want *-2 to \] finish , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###If you want *-1 to , do it quickly . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
159263:8	###You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence , E_S ###but then they leave the awards up to more learned people . E_S ###And I think 0 maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous , you know , like millions and millions of dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
159303:13	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###I think 0 maybe you look at , uh , the age of the person and their station in life \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , how much longer *ICH*-2 they have *T*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] that *T*-4 . E_S 
159419:27	###I 'm not talking about your isolated occurrences , E_S ###I 'm talking more about \[ the , \+ you know , the \] thing that they know *T*-1 , E_S ###maybe they 're willfully manufacturing something that they know 0 *T*-1 is hurting people out there E_S ###and they continue *-1 to do it even after they become aware of that . E_S 
159422:30	###and they continue *-1 to do it even after they become aware of that . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
160029:6	###Deductibles are really high , E_S ###it 's like fifteen hundred dollars , E_S ###but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because \[ it 's unlikely , \+ if you 're \[ f- , \+ relatively , \] uh , healthy , then it 's really unlikely \] that you 'd use that \[ much , \+ amount \] of money , you know . E_S ###So , \[ \[ the- , \+ \] it , \+ you know , someone \] did start a cost benefit analysis , E_S 
160203:21	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###and \[ that , \+ you know , that \] changes the character of it quite a bit . E_S 
160497:8	###SpeakerB88 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . 
160587:20	###but , N_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###SpeakerB134 . ###SpeakerA135 . 
161096:13	###SpeakerA25 . ###That 's good . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . 
162192:8	###but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher *ICH*-1 quality product than our , uh , car manufacturers have *?* for a while . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
162983:21	###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###\[ and , \+ but , \] the community 0 I 'm in *T*-1 is not a real large one , E_S 
163232:45	###SpeakerA33 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###And here 's *T*-2 this bum that *T*-1 did n't have a job E_S 
163325:9	###but I do n't know if they \[ get a , \+ get anything \] back on it E_S ###or , do you get money for it ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###No , E_S 
163360:39	###I started *-1 to see , at home , E_S ###I was like , God , how much were those bottles *T*-1 you know ? E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yes . E_S 
163395:11	###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . 
163402:26	###and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
163410:6	###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###\[ It , \+ it 's , \] N_S 
163632:9	###Uh , I N_S ###* let 's example , uh , N_S ###our friend , the President , right now , says no new taxes , E_S ###we should and especially , if anything , be cutting taxes now because of the recession E_S 
163638:15	###Now , \[ i- , \+ in \] terms of economics I 'm not , N_S ###it 's \[ hard , \+ hard \] 0 * to call *T*-1 . E_S ###It really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
163669:6	###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###I 'm not sure if we know what * to do *T*-2 in terms of * curing some who *T*-1 has already gotten polio . E_S 
163718:6	###and , uh , I lived in Massachusetts for a while E_S ###and , uh , when Dukakis vetoed certain things *T*-1 , there was a big uproar and was n't necessarily so popular . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S 
163919:57	###but \[ that 's \+ , that 's \] \[ what \+ \] the , point 0 we 've reached *T*-1 , E_S ###so I do n't know \[ how \+ how \] much farther we can digress *T*-1 before we have *-2 to turn it around and go the other way , at least . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S 
164112:13	###because I was getting ready *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] go in my car one morning E_S ###and the first thing 0 they said *T*-3 is , uh , you must do n't have *-1 to be to work at eight , you know , E_S ###like shock , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
164181:6	###and I think 0 that 's probably a little over kill for this day and age . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I was surprised *-1 to hear that the V eights are coming back , E_S 
164255:10	###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think that we 're going *-1 to be , uh , owning a mini van for some years 0 *T*-2 to come . E_S ###Probably till the kids are out of , uh , high school anyway . E_S 
164277:8	###You know , again , \[ we 've , \+ we 've \] got the same issue with *-1 getting kids into the , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###What kind of crime do you think , uh , 0 *T*-1 is the most prevalent in our society ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . 
164391:12	###and they , N_S ###it 's like oops , . E_S ###But , ###Uh-huh . E_S 
164447:6	###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah , E_S ###generally the crimes of passion and things like that , uh , are not premeditated . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . 
164552:30	###but I guess 0 \[ we , \+ uh , we 're \] kind of stuck with it . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] a difficult , uh , problem , is n't it *?* , * to determine how you 're going *-2 to punish somebody for a particular crime *T*-3 , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###But , then , you know , I think \[ that , \+ that \] some murderers do n't really warrant capital punishment . You know , \[ just , \+ \] like , for example , uh , you know , you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who *T*-1 abused them *T*-2 E_S 
164585:6	###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###I think in s- , N_S ###and it , just would depend upon the circumstances \[ and , \+ and \] the extent of the abuse \[ and , \+ and \] if another alternative was available . E_S 
164661:11	###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###And \[ I 'm in , \+ I 'm from \] South Carolina . E_S 
165375:8	###and the \[ lube , \+ lubrication \] system needs *-1 to be lubricated *-2 ###and N_S so \[ I , \+ I \] stay on top of that E_S ###but \[ I \+ I \] wanted my front wheels , E_S ###I wanted the bearings packed *-1 E_S 
165920:13	###SpeakerA43 . ###Ninety , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###Or , * excuse me , the ninety-twos . E_S 
166025:23	###Whether N_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ and I think that , \] \+ and I know \] 0 Massachusetts has , N_S ###a bottle bill was passed *-1 E_S ###and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now , E_S 
166068:8	###I work for a defense contractor . E_S ###And there 's a big push on for * recycling , uh , paper materials , you know , computer output paper and also * to decrease the amount of , uh , Styrofoam usage because of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] process involved in Styrofoam \[ and , \+ and \] the whole eco issue and that . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] they 're very proactive E_S ###and , uh , matter of fact , they give you discounts if you use , uh , china wear rather than , uh , Styrofoam stuff , E_S 
166295:8	###I mean , somebody 's \[ getting , \+ getting \] a good education because we , continue *-1 to employ people . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
166521:94	###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah . E_S ###It 's high dollar . E_S ###You know , \[ it 's all , \+ it 's all \] money now . E_S 
166763:6	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###That really burns me because , hey , you 're required *-1 . E_S 
166933:11	###They generally were able *-1 to have someone care for them at home E_S ###and they died . E_S ###But they were all , goodness , younger than your grandparents . E_S ###Like they were in their eighties . That type of thing . E_S 
167084:32	###They get too boring . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So , \[ you , \+ what you 're \] saying *T*-1 is this , if there is the second offense , then you execute them . E_S 
167126:28	###SpeakerA4 . ###Really , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't think 0 that 's a valid argument .

167189:8	###SpeakerB25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###See I 'm unfamiliar with that because \[ I do n't , \+ I never see \] that end of the business . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . 
167197:141	###SpeakerA28 . ###That 's true . E_S ###\[ \[ \[ I- , \+ i- , \] \+ a r- , \] \+ a big \] hole does exist right now , uh , in that consumers can just say oh , \[ I , \+ I \] forgot that . E_S ###\[ There , \+ there \] is no well defined mechanism at all E_S 
167301:11	###And * let me tell you , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] knew them personally , uh , not intimately , but quite well E_S ###and , uh , you 're talking about real trauma . I mean trauma that *T*-1 extends beyond the counting of bodies . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###I can imagine . E_S 
167857:48	###SpeakerB20 . ###What d- , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###\[ And , \+ uh you know , and so \] the students were , you know , to some extent , motivated *-1 to learn . E_S 
168909:8	###SpeakerB6 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . 
168919:14	###SpeakerB10 . ###It MUMBLEx thing actually . N_S ###Uh , I , uh , have worked at Texas Instruments . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
168998:48	###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###But , again , * to require , you know , such a test \[ and jus- , \+ and then \] to \[ make , \+ make \] it MUMBLEx is * to subject them \[ to , \+ to \] \[ discrimi- , \+ discriminatory \] practices and other things . E_S 
169134:11	###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , that *ICH*-1 's kind of gone up in scale \[ and , \+ and \] some other things . E_S 
169231:6	###and then they just slip in . ###* Slip in , slip out , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###That 's amazing . E_S 
169331:27	###SpeakerA81 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###it *EXP*-1 's against the law * to do a lot of things , you know . E_S 
169355:58	###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###and essentially what he had done *T*-1 is * set \[ \[ a , \+ a \] elec- , \+ a electrocution \] trap for the burglar in his own home . E_S 
169459:35	###SpeakerA33 . ###Right . E_S ###* Does n't want , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
169808:21	###and I know 0 they changed afterwards . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S 
169809:8	###SpeakerA11 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###See I know of that too . E_S 
169814:11	###And you can not get a job because of it E_S ###and they may not tell you the reason why . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
169850:10	###and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
170151:38	###And we did that pretty successfully for about three months E_S ###and then we started *-1 borrowing from one envelope *-2 to put it in the other envelope E_S ###and in about two months we were back to *-2 doing the same thing 0 we always do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
170251:14	###SpeakerB56 . ###Not very often . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] \[ I 'm just , \+ I 'm just \] saying 0 as a single person , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a drop in the bucket . E_S 
170553:9	###and my little one also competed because really she had no choice . E_S ###She had *-1 to go with me . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
170630:31	###SpeakerA74 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###SpeakerA76 . 
170783:8	###Because he does n't even charge me \[ for , \+ for \] * doing it E_S ###so he 's not going *-1 to , you know , take me . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right . E_S 
170848:9	###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###They wanted some place 0 they can go and have their meals *T*-1 and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her E_S 
170894:52	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So that was their thinking . E_S 
171298:11	###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S ###tha- , N_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
171461:57	###something was very , very wrong with the blade . E_S ###Uh , what about you ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Well , I do n't have so much trouble with products as service . E_S 
172178:9	###But I think 0 most lawyers do a pretty good job of * making that evident \[ to , \+ to \] clients unless they feel 0 they can , you know , tweak a jury into \[ per- , \+ \] *-1 giving a different sentence or possibly , if it 's a civil case , giving higher , uh , you know , awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of \[ the , \+ the \] award . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###* Giving a different sentence . E_S 
172730:34	###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh , I do too . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###uh , uh , I really think that we need *-1 to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks *T*-2 . E_S 
172848:6	###but they 're giving it to other people that *T*-1 do n't really need it \[ ei- , \+ either , \] E_S ###but yet they accept it . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , the thing of it is , 0 if I wanted *-1 to just , uh , you know , permanently become a book reader , I guess 0 *T*-3 I could just , uh , you know , uh , go on public assistance , uh , you know \[ \[ \[ lo- , \+ lo- , \] \+ look for , \] \+ uh , look for \] people 0 *T*-2 to , uh , take care of me . E_S 
173648:15	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###\[ And , \+ and \] I quite frankly , do n't see anything wrong with it . E_S 
173737:24	###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###well that 's why there 's , you know , people dealing it because there 's money in it *T*-1 , you know . E_S 
174253:40	###and that 's what the trial by jury . N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I know MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
174913:30	###or else they would have said something . E_S ###Uh , I 'm sure 0 they screen for just a particular few types . E_S ###Although the literature 0 they give *T*-1 with you says yeah we do this E_S ###and then they list about five thousand drugs 0 they try *-1 to test for *T*-2 . E_S 
175101:13	###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###For example , I have a brother in North Carolina E_S

175204:28	###SpeakerB68 . ###Well , E_S ###and you ca n't put all the children in special education . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . 
175358:50	###SpeakerB42 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###\[ Yo- , \+ you \] know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S 
175493:20	###We 're changing departments . E_S ###We 're changing policies . E_S ###We 're changing * doing other kinds of things . Which *T*-1 to me \[ is , \+ is \] disturbing . E_S ###I mean , I feel like if , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't necessarily need *-1 to , uh , be involved since I 'm pretty much on a low level , E_S 
175619:13	###because , you know , if we do n't want that to happen all 0 we have *-1 to do *T*-2 is * just call the phone company and say , * look , you know , I want my name unlisted or want my , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] that does n't work . E_S ###SpeakerA9 .
