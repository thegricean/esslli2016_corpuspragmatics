This 5-day course is part of [ESSLLI 2016](http://esslli2016.unibz.it/). It aims to introduce students to the use of corpora of naturally occurring language for research in semantics/pragmatics.

In order to make the course as useful as possible to the greatest number of participants, **please fill out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEFAbBObNEkY4VoCX4Vbj4D-6NwhCMXoyN3GnVhe6Jv4srtg/viewform) by August 9**!

# Course description

Traditionally, the primary source of data in pragmatics has been researchers’ intuitions about utterance meanings. However, small numbers of introspective judgments about examples hand-selected by researchers who themselves provide these judgments, introduce bias into the  phenomena under investigation.  The recently emerging use of experimental methods for probing linguistically untrained  hearers’ interpretations has ameliorated the bias introduced by small numbers of judgments. It cannot, however, remove item bias: researchers  artificially construct the stimuli used in experiments. Fortunately, studying corpora of naturally occurring language can reduce item bias. Corpora provide naturally occurring utterances that can be used in tandem with platforms like Mechanical Turk to provide large-scale crowd-sourced interpretations of these utterances, thereby allowing for constructing large databases of different types of meanings (e.g., implicatures) in context. The course will introduce students to the use of corpora of naturally occurring language for research in semantics/pragmatics.
